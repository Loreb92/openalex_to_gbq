roles	RECORD	REPEATED	List of role objects, which include the role (one of institution, funder, or publisher), the id (OpenAlex ID), and the works_count. In many cases, a single organization does not fit neatly into one role.

The roles property links the OpenAlex entities together for a single organization, and includes counts for the works associated with each role. The roles list of an entity (Funder, Publisher, or Institution) always includes itself. In the case where an organization only has one role, the roles will be a list of length one, with itself as the only item.
