name	type	mode	description
abstract_inverted_index	RECORD	NULLABLE	The abstract of the work, as an inverted index, which encodes information about the abstract’s words and their positions within the text. Like Microsoft Academic Graph, OpenAlex doesn’t include plaintext abstracts due to legal constraints.
abstract_inverted_index.keys	STRING	REPEATED	Custom field created by COKI. Originally each word in the abstract was a key and the indices of where this word occurred inside the abstract the corresponding value.
abstract_inverted_index.values	STRING	REPEATED	Custom field created by COKI. Originally each word in the abstract was a key and the indices of where this word occurred inside the abstract the corresponding value.
apc_list	RECORD	NULLABLE	Objects containing information about the APC (article processing charge) for this work. This value is the APC list price–the price as listed by the journal’s publisher. That’s not always the price actually paid, because publishers may offer various discounts to authors. Unfortunately we don’t always know this discounted price, but when we do you can find it in apc_paid. Currently our only source for this data is DOAJ, and so doaj is the only value for apc_list.provenance, but we’ll add other sources over time.
apc_list.currency	STRING	NULLABLE	
apc_list.price	INTEGER	NULLABLE	
apc_list.price_usd	INTEGER	NULLABLE	APC converted to USD
apc_list.provenance	STRING	NULLABLE	
apc_paid	RECORD	NULLABLE	Object: Information about the paid APC (article processing charge) for this work. You can find the listed APC price (when we know it) for a given work using apc_list. However, authors don’t always pay the listed price; often they get a discounted price from publishers. So it’s useful to know the APC actually paid by authors, as distinct from the list price. This is our effort to provide this. Our best source for the actually paid price is the OpenAPC project. Where available, we use that data, and so apc_paid.provenance is openapc. Where OpenAPC data is unavailable (and unfortunately this is common) we make our best guess by assuming the author paid the APC list price, and apc_paid.provenance will be set to wherever we got the list price from.
apc_paid.currency	STRING	NULLABLE	
apc_paid.price	INTEGER	NULLABLE	
apc_paid.price_usd	INTEGER	NULLABLE	APC converted to USD

display_name	STRING	NULLABLE	Exactly the same as Work.title. It’s useful for Works to include a display_name property, since all the other entities have one.
doi	STRING	NULLABLE	The DOI for the work. This is the Canonical External ID for works. Occasionally, a work has more than one DOI–for example, there might be one DOI for a preprint version hosted on bioRxiv, and another DOI for the published version. However, this field always has just one DOI, the DOI for the published work.

is_oa	BOOLEAN	NULLABLE	Set to true if the work hosted here can be read for free, without registration.
is_paratext	BOOLEAN	NULLABLE	True if we think this work is paratext. In our context, paratext is stuff that’s in scholarly venue (like a journal) but is about the venue rather than a scholarly work properly speaking. Some examples and nonexamples: yep it’s paratext: front cover, back cover, table of contents, editorial board listing, issue information, masthead. no, not paratext: research paper, dataset, letters to the editor, figures Turns out there is a lot of paratext in registries like Crossref. That’s not a bad thing… but we’ve found that it’s good to have a way to filter it out. We determine is_paratext algorithmically using title heuristics.
is_retracted	BOOLEAN	NULLABLE	True if we know this work has been retracted. This field has high precision but low recall. In other words, if is_retracted is  true, the article is definitely retracted. But if is_retracted is False,  it still might be retracted, but we just don’t know. This is because unfortunately, the open sources for retraction data aren’t currently very comprehensive, and the more comprehensive ones aren’t sufficiently open for us to use here.
language	STRING	NULLABLE	The language of the work in ISO 639-1 format. The language is automatically detected using the information we have about the work. We use the langdetect software library on the words in the work’s abstract, or the title if we do not have the abstract. The source code for this procedure is here. Keep in mind that this method is not perfect, and that in some cases the language of the title or abstract could be different from the body of the work.
license	STRING	NULLABLE	The license applied to this work at this host. Most toll-access works don’t have an explicit license (they’re under “all rights reserved” copyright), so this field generally has content only if is_oa is true.

open_access.any_repository_has_fulltext	BOOLEAN	NULLABLE	
open_access.is_oa	BOOLEAN	NULLABLE	True if this work is Open Access (OA). There are many ways to define OA. OpenAlex uses a broad definition: having a URL where you can read the fulltext of this work without needing to pay money or log in. You can use the locations and oa_status fields to narrow your results further, accommodating any definition of OA you like.
open_access.oa_status	STRING	NULLABLE	The Open Access (OA) status of this work. Possible values are: -gold: Published in an OA journal that is indexed by the DOAJ. -green: Toll-access on the publisher landing page, but there is a free copy in an OA repository. -hybrid: Free under an open license in a toll-access journal. -bronze: Free to read on the publisher landing page, but without any identifiable license. -closed: All other articles.
open_access.oa_url	STRING	NULLABLE	The best Open Access (OA) URL for this work. Although there are many ways to define OA, in this context an OA URL is one where you can read the fulltext of this work without needing to pay money or log in. The “best” such URL is the one closest to the version of record. This URL might be a direct link to a PDF, or it might be to a landing page that links to the free PDF

The score represents the model’s predicted probability of the work’s relevance for a particular goal.

type	STRING	NULLABLE	The type or genre of the work. This field uses Crossref’s “type” controlled vocabulary; you can see all possible values via the Crossref api here: https://api.crossref.org/types . Where possible, we just pass along Crossref’s type value for each work. When that’s impossible (eg the work isn’t in Crossref), we do our best to figure out the type ourselves. Unfortunately the accuracy of Crossref’s data for this isn’t great, and ours isn’t much better. We’re working to develop better type classification.
